<p>Dear Current or Future Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>If you’re reading this, you’re either working at a real estate brokerage or a new agent looking to get a headstart on your career.</p>

<p>Let make a few guesses about your current circumstances:</p>

<p>If you’re already an agent, you probably aren’t getting the support that you need in order to advance your career. Many brokerages don’t offer the leads, training, coaching, accountability, or structure required to succeed in this business. You might be jumping around from brokerage to brokerage and buying leads from different sources, hoping for success but not seeing it. <strong>In fact, 87% of real estate agents will fail to achieve the level of success they want and leave the industry within their first five years.</strong> A majority of the agents I’ve interviewed in their first few years haven’t even sold any homes aside from their own.  </p>

<p>You might long for a kind of lifestyle that your current job can’t afford you—the freedom to maintain your life outside of work as you please, the money to support your family as well as your personal goals, and the time to make all of it a reality.</p>

<p>If you’re kept awake at night because you can’t guarantee where your next check will come from or trying to find new business, you probably can't wait for guidance to help alleviate the stress from your shoulders. Maybe You’re spending money on all the different Ideas from all the Facebook REALTOR Coaches and just want a clear path to success.</p>

<p><strong>Perhaps you’ve already sought out a solution to these problems.</strong> There are numerous companies out there that promise to deliver quality leads that you can convert into clients, therefore allowing you to grow in your business and personal life. The trouble is, many of these are merely marketing mirages designed only to recruit you, not to nurture your professional and personal interests. You might focus your attention on whether a brokerage offers a high split, but you should know that those don’t provide you with the highest value or the coaching you actually need. If you don’t get that support, you’ll be back working a 9 to 5 before you know it.</p>

<p>With all that in mind, here’s the thing: If you don’t do something different with your career, you’ll probably wind up in that 87% of industry beginners—admitting defeat and leaving real estate forever. You’ll go back to a regular office job, forego the comfortable lifestyle you always dreamed of, and re-enter the cycle of making ends meet.</p>

<p>But don’t let your frustrations, anxieties, and past misfortunes get you down. <strong>There is a solution to your problems, and it doesn’t involve letting the real estate business chew you up and spit you out:</strong></p>

<p>I’d like to invite you in for a discussion about becoming a member of our brokerage.</p>

<p><strong>My name is Jd Walters, and at the beginning of my career, I was failing miserably.</strong> I worked at a big-box brokerage where I was making 90% of nothing. I didn’t have the leads, I didn’t have the proper training, and I didn’t know where to go next. I did have to go back to the 9-to-5 lifestyle while staying as a Realtor part-time. </p>

<p>After saving up six months of income, I went back into the business in 2010 and developed a team. 10 years later, here I am helping agents who were in the same miserable spot achieve what I’ve been able to achieve. We focus on dollar-producing activities, create a tight schedule, and help you create a niche for yourself to grow in.</p>

<p>I sell maybe one to two homes per year to relatives; I hand off all of the other leads I receive to our agents. I don’t compete with my agents. <strong>My main focus is making them successful.</strong> I don’t treat my agents like a number. I treat them like family and work my hardest to help them achieve their goals.</p>

<p>Let me be a little more specific about what my team has to offer:
<ul class="indent">
<li>A licensed transaction coordinator to help you focus more on dollar-producing activities and less on minutia.</li>
<li>A website for you to direct clients to, and a CRM within that website</li>
<li>Paperless transactions</li>
<li>A plan to get repeat business</li>
<li>The opportunity to have a strong work-life balance</li>
<li>Yard Signs</li>
Local Office
</ul></p>

<p>By joining me, I can help you find success in this business and help you make the money you need to achieve your goals and dreams. I’ll work with you, offering my expertise, and guide you expertly toward your goals.</p>

<p><strong>If you take me up on my offer to explore whether our team is right for you, I’d be glad to show you that we’re not all just talk</strong>—we can prove that what we say actually happens. We can help you make the most money possible in your career without having to sacrifice your work-life balance in the process.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t just take my word for it. Consider the story of Logan</strong>
He was a sales manager in the area making around $80,000 per year and I had been recruiting him for four years. He was working weekends, missing family vacations, and didn’t have the freedom to live his life to the fullest. </p>

<p>I finally was able to convince him and his wife that he would make at least the same amount of money with me while also having much more freedom. He did everything I told him and sold 62 houses in just his first year. Four years later, he’s still with me and closed close to $10 million in sales over the last year.</p>

<p>There’s also Nicole, my sister-in-law. She has an amazing knack for converting leads, but was only working in the business part time. She’s focused on being a mom first and an agent second. Working with us, she was able to continue to be a great mom while making $75,000 a year just as a part-time agent. After taking a year off, she already has eight homes under contract in February alone. </p>

<p><strong>Here’s what I’m offering you: If you join our team, we offer a 50/50 split for our leads and 60/40 for your own. After you hit $3 million, that split moves up to 70/30.</strong></p>

<p>Then again, you could also elect to go a different route. But I’ll warn you: Other big-box brokerages often foster a dog-eat-dog atmosphere in which you’re technically a part of the brand, but still left to succeed (or fail) on your own. Many will spend a lot of their time calling or texting you so they can recruit you, but once you’re there, they don’t provide the resources you need to grow your business. Others still will promise you quality leads but, in reality, will provide you with weak ones from people who aren’t really interested in buying or selling homes. They also won’t hold you to the same productivity and educational standards that we will.
<strong>After you join our team, here’s what the onboarding process looks like:</strong> A three-week intensive training that teaches you our systems, from lead generation to dialing software, writing a contract, and more. We’ll go over our core values, our scripts, and everything you need to know to start off on the right foot.</p>

<p>The choice is yours: Face an uncertain industry full of mirages and false promises on your own—or become an agent on our team, consistently netting a strong salary while maintaining a lifestyle fit for you and your family. </p>

<p><strong>I guarantee that I can help you get 12 transactions from our leads and teach you how to get 12 transactions on your own in your first year. That’s 24 transactions total.</strong></p>

<p>If your interest has been piqued, I do urge you to act quickly. The popular real estate service Redfin is gearing up for a massive advertising campaign across the U.S. to offer clients a low-commission environment. If you don’t have your business system in place before then, you’ll get crushed. I’m not looking for quantity, I’m looking for quality. <strong>If you fit the standard we’re looking for, I strongly urge you to reach out today.</strong></p>

<p>Let’s get together now so we can make sure you succeed in real estate regardless of what happens next.  I hope to hear from you soon!</p>
