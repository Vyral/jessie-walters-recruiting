<center><em>These are three steps to staying in touch with clients while contacting new ones.</em></center>

<br>How do you stay in touch with past customers, while also having time to reach out to new ones? I’m answering that question in three parts:

**1\. Invest in customer relationship management (CRM)**. This is the very first thing you should do. Examples are Follow Up Boss, Top Producer, Hubspot, and more. CRMs filter all your leads into one place and allow you to create a drip system to send monthly emails, automatic texts, messages sent straight to their voicemail, etc. In my opinion, Follow Up Boss is the best; it integrates with all the lead generation programs.

**2\. Hire a marketing company**. Spend a little money to hire a company like <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.getvyral.com/">Vyral Marketing</a></u> that will allow you to send videos to your database. I use Vyral, and they help me send out two videos to my database per month, as well as utilize other marketing strategies.

**3\. Call-to-Actions**. If you’re not ready for much marketing, address your database with call-to-actions through a company like Agent Dominator, which will send out postcards, re-target people on Facebook, and send a monthly newsletter.

The key to staying in touch with your database and also reaching out to new people is finding a way to automate it. If you don’t have any kind of CRM set up and have questions or want to implement this, give me a call or send a text. I’d be glad to help you.
