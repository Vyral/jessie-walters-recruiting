<center><em>When is the best time to prospect for buyers and sellers?</em></center>

<br>When should you be prospecting for new business? Is morning or afternoon better? The best time for prospecting is in the morning. MIT did a study that reported **the ideal time for making prospecting calls is between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m.**

If for some reason you can’t devote that time to prospecting, then do it between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. Both of these times will work, but the morning has proven to be most effective.

If you’re having trouble fitting prospecting into your business, feel free to reach out to me via phone at (254) 598-2272 or <u><a href="mailto:jessie@jdwaltersrealestate.com">email me</a></u>&nbsp;and I’ll help you negotiate your time to get new buyers and sellers consistently. As always, if you have any questions, please contact me as well.
