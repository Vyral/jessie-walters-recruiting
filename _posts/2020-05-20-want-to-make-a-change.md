<center><em>If you&rsquo;re looking to make a career change, check out our team.</em></center>

<br>I’m Nicole Juarez from JD Walters Real Estate, and I’m sharing the story of how I became a successful Realtor. I began my career in real estate about four years ago with no training, working nine hours every day. The first year I didn’t have any sales training, so when I came to JD Walters, **I was readily offered access to training and all the other tools that would help me become a successful real estate agent**. Now, I’m making more money, I’m in charge of creating my own work schedule, and I love what I do.&nbsp;
