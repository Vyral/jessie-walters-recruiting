  about_markdown: >-
    Back in 2004, I became licensed to work for a company that offered leads and
    a lower split, eventually leaving for a company that provided a high split
    and no leads. I made 90% on two closings, which led to us being out of
    business within 18 months.


    In 2008, Realtors were quitting the business right and left, so I decided to
    take a leap of faith and jumped back in headfirst. I made a commitment to
    God that I would put Him first, be a servant to all our customers, and set a
    standard to not work on Wednesday evenings or Sunday mornings.


    In 2012, I was able to start my own company; I used the $100,000+ I had been
    investing since 2008 to create a proven, repeatable system that would allow
    me to coach other agents to go from having zero deals to becoming a rockstar
    agent in 12 months.
