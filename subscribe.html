<p>Are you looking for training that teaches you exactly what you need to do to sell homes specifically right here in {{site.data.settings.client.market}}?</p>

</ol></p>

<p>Our goal is to give you a taste of the training we provide if you have any interest in working with us in the future.</p>

<p>We have no intention of recruiting you - that’s a conversation with us when you are ready, if at all.</p>

<p>Last year 28,824 homes sold in the greater {{site.data.settings.client.market}} market.</p>

<p>That’s plenty of business to go around for all of us.</p>

<p>We’ve been fortunate to sell 179 homes last year and our average agent earns six figures a year with us.</p>

<p>The same training they get will help you do it as well.</p>

<p><strong><em>"Thank you Jessie for the Covid-19 training you offered it was an eye opener to me. I will definitely implement this training immediately. Not only did you give some good advice on how to stay safe from Covid-19 you also did some roll play with me on how to talk to a possible client who is worried about buying a home because of the future of the economy and how to approach them with out being aggressive. I left the training class with lots of Confidence,I will definitely be attending more of your training, thank you Jessie!!"</em></strong></p>

<p><br/><strong><em>"Mr. Walters I recently attended your Covid-19 training. The training was very informative and had pertinent scenarios that is currently happening in the real estate industry. The explanation and breakdown of the different rejections and ideas of how to work through them were detailed and applicable. Thank you for this training, it was very helpful."</em></strong></p>
